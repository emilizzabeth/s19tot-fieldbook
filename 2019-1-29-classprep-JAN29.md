##Class Preparation
###January 29

In discussing the "literacy" of computer programming, Vee first breaks down the proficiency standards of a (unspecified) language: "That is, a language should have a low barrier to entry (low floors), allow a lot of room
for growing in proficiency (high ceilings), make room for a diversity of applications (wide walls), and enable people to share what they write (open windows)" (11). She then goes on to describe how the UK Department of Education issues guidelines for their computer programming class(es?). The thing that stuck out most in my head while reading this is the specification of _a_ language in the parallel Vee draws. I know next to nothing about computer programming, aside from what is described in this text and what little I have gleaned over the years. I can do Markdown, some HTML, and some CSS, but that's where I draw the line. Keeping that in mind, isn't there more than one type of programming language? From a non-programmer point of view, I think it would be unfair to grouply judge someone's "literacy" in a language, that for the purposes of this comparison, is actually several fragmented dialects, most with a low rate of mutual intelligibility (again, I know nothing about programming. I could be wrong in this comparison). Furthermore, yes, computers are becoming more prominent in society, and yes, technology is advancing as such that it might be helpful to have knowledge of some of these languages, but I think it would be unfair to expect _everyone_ to know all, or even most, of the varying coding components that go make up the field of computer science. To take things even further, there is something to be said for the availability of online resources. Taking again the comparison of an actual language, while it is more efficient to learn to fluency an entire language, it is also less time consuming to learn the language to a necessary level (say, beginner, for a tourist) and carry around a dictionary. Extending this metaphor to the computer world, would it not be the same to encourage a base-knowledge of computer languages (say, enough for the user to understand vaguely what they are looking at) and assume the use of outside sources as reference, rather than spend hours learning every intricate detail of something they may only use a handful of times in their life? That all being said, I don't argue against Vee's point that there are a number of fields in which such a knowledge might be useful. I just think that this usefulness **does** have a limit, in the same way that knowing French, while incredibly useful in fields like diplomacy, art, or translation, is only peripherally useful and likely to be referenced a mere handful of times in the lives of others, such as perhaps engineers or biologists (barring, of course, extreme circumstances). I do agree with Vee's analysis of computer literacy as a type of writing and language comprehension, and I would agree that a code or program is, in fact, a form of "text". However, I would argue that when considering this, the texts should be treated individually, as part of something larger, more akin to the division of a language family in a language tree - with many offshoots - than a single holistic skill. It seems thus that literacy, to Vee, would encompass the knowledge possessed perhaps by a college student with a Computer Science major (again, knowing little about CS myself, I'm stretching comparisons here). Yet, in the same way it would be unfair to deem a French speaker illiterate for not having the ability to write Chinese, it seems equally inept to mark the division of computer literacy by similar standards of wholesome knowledge versus a proficiency in certain niche aspects.

With regard to the Cushman reading, I found it an interesting study in the development of a writing system. However, much like Cushman is afraid of in the beginning, the teaching system of the Sequoia Cherokee writing system seems focused on preservation rather than perseverance. Language is adaptable, and the writing system is intended to reflect the needs and usage of the current body of language users. As such, where can the line be drawn between preservation and perseverance? Would it be best to divide the languages into Historical Sequoia Cherokee and Modern Sequoia Cherokee (in the same lines of Old and Modern English)? This would accommodate the usage and understanding of current youth learners, who seem to have little usage for the historical meanings encoded in the writing system. Or would this be considered a means of erasure, to eliminate this aspect from the writing? It makes for an interesting point of analysis, because a language that is rigid and does not adapt will likely die out due to irrelevancy, whereas on the other hand, a language that has changed beyond recognition is not necessarily the same language anymore.
