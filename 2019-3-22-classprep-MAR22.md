## Class Preparation
### March 22

Something that struck me about today's section of reading from _Lovelace and Babbage_ is just how futuristic and ahead of their time the theories of these two were. Normally, I tend to read main text first and footnotes after (as a way of grouping things and keeping myself from feeling too frazzled), but this time I had to read the footnotes in conjunction with the text, because I kept thinking the text had sprung into the present day in a "future pocket universe" of sorts. Especially when I got to the page about "the cloud," I had to stop and re-orient myself. I doubt Lovelace and Babbage actually called their data storage this, and there is no footnote to indicate the truth, but it definitely threw me for a loop. 

As far as the text goes, going back to one of the first pages, the author adds a footnote on 155 saying something is "what is known in the pocket universe as..." This is particularly striking to me because it notes a departure from the other factual and historical footnotes, and it feels like a bleeding of borders between the fictitious world Padua has created for Lovelace and Babbage and the reality she contrasts with in the footnotes. Perhaps this is a method of encouraging the readers to engage with the footnotes as well as the text, and thus as a result the  actual educational content as well as the fun of the story. Given the re-mention of pocket universes, another thing I started pondering was Padua's choice to focus the majority of the text upon Lovelace and Babbage's theoretical ideas, and less on their actual lives. It presents a strange contrast, because while the book title indicates the book is about the figures themselves, the content seems to be focused on conveying the stories of the intangible while using the two figures as vessels. I think this is actually a great way to present complicated material, because it 1) makes it entertaining, 2) allows it to both visually and textually represented, and 3) gives a platform to something that would otherwise be confined to textbooks, all the while publicizing two important historical figures.
