## Class Preparation
### March 19

Last semester I took Professor Chute's The Graphic Novel class, so I was stoked to open up _Lovelace and Babbage_ to find that it was a graphic novel, particularly because we discussed how graphic novels are not always incorporated into literary studies or academic fields. _Lovelace and Babbage_ so far, in my opinion, is a great example of how graphic novels can make otherwise dense content accessible and enticing to the everyday consumer. The format works especially well in regard to the footnotes Padua weaves in with the story, even more so after the "pocket universe" divide. True (? at least, as an outside reader with no prior knowledge of the subject, I would assume these are true) anecdotes and small "unimportant" details are weaved into short skits in the graphic format, brought to light by imagery and creativity when these aforementioned details might have otherwise been glossed over in a larger biography or Wikipedia page. In short, I think the fictional-graphic format Padua presents Lovelace and Babbage in throughout her work almost does more for the visibility of these two so-called unrecognized figures than any other form of publicity or documentation could.
