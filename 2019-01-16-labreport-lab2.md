##Lab Report
###Jan 16

The three works I chose for my lab were _The history and survey of London_ Volume 1 (1756) by William Maitland and others, _The Rhine from Rotterdam to Constance_ (1900) by Karl Baedeker, and digitally, the _Nuremburg Chronicle_ by Hartmann Schedel. I tried to select spreads that seemed similar in visual layout and substance because I am interested in the ways each book used the space to convey history for different purposes. 

_The history and survey of London_ was paginated and included a note of the volume (Book 1) in the top header. The book was made with cloth "paper", evidenced by the lines visible when a light was shone through. The typeface was standard Roman type, with occasional italics and marginal notes (in standard type). Furthermore, the history was divided by chapter headings _and_ by year, which was a fascinating division. On the opposing page was a picture of London Bridge, which was labeled as such with a header, yet it did not seem to correspond to any specific event in the history on the text-filled page. There was no date, appendix, image number, or any other identifying detail. Although the book was large and seemingly important, the pages viewed seemed mundane and more akin to a reference material than a display piece. 

I would consider _The Rhine from Rotterdam to Constance_ a practical modern derivation of the _London_ book. It seemed more used and in ways, older than the _London_ book. Northeastern had stamped it on the side, and the page spread I opened to had a map with chips of paper missing. The paper was paper, and the fold-out map was in color with a key and labeling. The text page had pagination and seemed to indicate the book was also organized by a route method, as it listed "Route 9" in the top margin as well. The text size, though also Roman with italics, was not standard. It varied in size seemingly randomly throughout lines of text. Based on the organization of the book, and the textual cues combined with the visual cues (the map with a key), the text seemed to indicate it was meant to be interacted with and usable by many, whereas the _London_ book seemed to assume knowledge. Furthermore, the _Rhine_ book was small, portable, and as stated earlier, well-loved.

From what is visible in the online version, the _Nuremburg Chronicles_ seems to sit somewhere in between these two books. Based on the writing-style, page coloration, and inking, my guess would be that it is written on parchment, indicating it would sit in with the "collector"-esque nature of the _London_ book. Yet, more like the _Rhine_ book, the images **on the text page** are labeled and appear to correspond to the text. However, the larger spread-like image on the opposing page merely contains the label "Zion", once again more like the photo of London Bridge that is generic and labeled loosely. _Nuremburg_ comes with headers and pagination (though only on the right-hand page of the spread). It seems to indicate that the pages are considered a set and go together, as the pages following the spread I chose are displayed in a similar layout and the page number is n+1 to the prior. (The specific spread I was viewing is pages 220-221, listed as "LXXXVIII" on the spread itself). The book is large in size and intricate in detail, but the hand-scribed text appears (from a non-speaker of the language) to be user-friendly. It comes with larger letters indicating line breaks, imagery corresponding to text, and an easy-to-follow format.

The takeaway from these three books of different time periods is mainly that books adapt based on producability (is that a word?), availability, and  necessity. By the time the _Rhine_ book came out, another long book of history was likely not necessary, owing perhaps to libraries, modern encyclopedias, and an opportunity to produce books at a larger scale for a broader audience. Thus, the book is more user-friendly, contains condensed information to cover perhaps wider topics or go in-depth on important pieces, and is smaller for portability. The two earlier books reflect the novelty of books during their respective time periods and the rarity of their production. As such, they are larger, more intricate, and prone to including massive quantities of information, perhaps not always organized well as the goal is inclusion rather than ease of access. The pages help indicate these uses for all of the books because as was stated in one of the readings (I cannot recall which), books and media have adapted to the needs of society. Pages likewise have adapted to the needs of the reader. Something that is more organized, includes redundancy for ease of use, and is thoroughly labeled indicates a user-friendly piece. Something that is large, small-type, and concerned with how much it can contain rather than who is using it indicates a book for novelty, a book for record-keeping, or a book not intended for marketability. Again, the book and the page adapt to the reader, and there are still books to this day that likely match the form of the _London_ and _Nuremburg_ books, however, over time the book seems to have adapted to consumption by the broader public and the ease of production that came with modern inventions.
