## Lab Report 5
### Feb 20

When talking about spacing in printing, Lynch states, "The negative space indicates that this concise message is more dear, in both its meaning and its cost, than whatever would otherwise occupy the page."  Thinking about this quote with regard to the letterpress assignment, one thing that I took into consideration when assembling my piece was just that: the blank space available. For my piece, I am printing the _Leave No Trace_ principles - seven short statements on proper outdoor conduct and preservation - which could easily be compactly listed. However, I wanted them to be notable, legible, and have more gravitas than a mere list. This is where I found Lynch's piece most applicable. She states, "It is never seen, but without it, everything printed would be nonsense" (Lynch). We don't pay much attention to the space, as Lynch noted, but we do notice when things are cramped together. The more spaced something is, the more likely we are to take notice of what is there. Something about the absence of type draws more attention to what _is_ written. 

Building off of this, Gayomali discusses type design in his piece, stating that "Type design is something we tend not to think about when we're reading," which is definitely true. We consider if we can read it, or if we cannot, but rarely stop to consider what the font itself has to add to the piece. Gayomali continues on to say, "But font can have real-world implications that affect our lives in tangible ways," before explaining the conundrum of the Higgs Boson presentation. On a much smaller scale, my project faced the same considerations. Script would be too fancy and lend itself more to the fantasy of the principles (the romanticism of the outdoors) than to digesting the message being conveyed. Too small of a font would signal unimportance while too large of a font would give a vibe of "public warning" and not "rules to live by." 

Thus, both the font and the spacing of the project came into consideration during the letterpress activities. As English majors (for the most of us), we so often study the words themselves and what they are saying, but fail to consider the way those words are presented, in font and in spacing. The act of reading without seeing reminds me much of semantics in linguistics, where something might _say_ one thing but _mean_ another. Without considering these choices, are we really getting the full meaning of a printing? What can be said for authors who have no choice over the presentation of their pieces, and are bound by publisher standards or choices? And, building off of Gayomali's studies, how many books have had their popularity impacted by a font that isn't underlyingly aesthetically pleasing? These all seem like  questions that go unthought of in a digital age, where font is just a button clicked and not something painstakingly arranged.
