## Class Preparation
### February 8

Reading about Cawdrey's attempt at the dictionary _immediately_ sent me down the "LANGUAGE IS FLUID, YOU'RE RUINING IT BY ARCHIVING IT!" track, so I was awfully pleased when Gleick decided to cover that train of thought for me. However, I did also appreciate Gleick's acknowledgement that, "The dictionary ratifies the persistence of the word" (66). This is a thought that didn't occur to me as I was thinking about the stagnancy of the dictionary: as much as it often solidifies a usage and enables a perceived "lawfulness" that need not always be strived for, the dictionary also helps revive "dead" (if you'll allow the borrowing of that word) terms and helps to keep in history the way language has been used before. Without the dictionary, is it possible that language may have become over-simplified? Gleick notes that Cawdrey compiled 2500 words in his dictionary, which stuck out to me particularly because it is said that 2000 words comprise of 80% of language usage (56).  (In other words, if you're learning a language, learn the most popular 2000 spoken words first, and you'll understand 80% of conversations). As a side note to language-speaking, I found the skeuomorphism of "mother-tongue" an entertaining fact to read, because I had never before heard the quote of "Some men seek so far for outlandish English, that they forget all together their mothers language" (55). At any rate, while Cawdrey's endeavor to create a list of words certainly had a dampening effect on the fluidity of language, it also likely helped solidify mutual understanding. 

Any combination of sounds said with a certain intonation between two parties familiar with said intonation could convey a meaning oblivious to "non-speakers". For example, my roommate and I often use a sympathetic-sounding, "Yeah?" to convey the meaning, "Is that the mood you're feeling right now?" I attempted to apply the same usage with a new group of friends recently, thinking they would likely glean what I was trying to say, but instead I got confused looks, and, "Why are you saying, "yeah?" to me after I went to get another cup of coffee?" They didn't understand I was asking, "Are you tired/has it been a rough day? You really needed that cup of coffee, didn't you?" with a simpler turn of phrase. So, to tie this back to Cawdrey: while his dictionary made synonyms easier to differentiate, and while he would have hypothetically made sense of my dorms, "Yeah?" language, the dictionary has its downfall with the side-effect of creating a "proper" sense of language.

Similarly, Hooks's piece and its analysis of Renaissance studying practices seems to echo this side-effect of elitism and stagnancy. The idea that reading without understanding and engaging is both bad business practice and bad education practice is respectable, however, the idea that it must be done a certain way seemed awry. Not everyone learns the same way, and if these practices don't contribute to personal engagement with a text, then isn't it just the same as not doing it at all, i.e., not engaging with the text? I do think that passive reading, in some cases, has its place. Not every single tiny bit of knowledge needs to be absorbed, processed, and engaged with - if we did that, we might go insane. Thus, I can appreciate the conclusion of the piece that briefly mentions information overload. Returning momentarily to the idea of Brinsley's that, "Reading passively is not just bad scholarship; it's bad business, too," I had never considered it that way. It reminds me almost of the thing students, teachers, and parents tell each other when considering skipping class: "You _are_ paying about $300 for every class, and you're wasting it when you skip one." So I suppose there is a point to be made for active engagement as well. It just seems like they both need to have their places.
