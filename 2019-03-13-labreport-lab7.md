## Lab Report 7
### Mar 13

The two newspapers I considered were _The Salt Lake Daily Herald_ and _The St. Louis Globe-Democrat_. To first answer the question broadly, newspapers seemed to be less about "news" than they are today - or at the very least, news had a different definition. As far as content went, both seemed less concerned with being _current_ and more concerned with providing circulatory material to discuss with others, probably considered "new" in the sense of new to talk about. For example, the Salt Lake City newspaper contained an eclectic mix of pieces, including a poem for courage, happenings in other states such as California and Oregon, an official directory of public offices, entries that can only be categorized as "call-out" pieces, and then - only after all of that - were short news briefs no longer than a handful of sentences included in the paper. The St. Louis paper did seem to want to include more substantive things for the readers to talk about, but reached as far as Ireland and Mexico to supply updates. A temperature for **yesterday** was also included alongside the image of a thermometer (though skewed to represent times of day correlating to temperatures rather than a traditional, accurate visual reproduction).

If I had to surmise the difference between newspapers then and newspapers now in a short sentence, I would describe it as follows: Newspapers today focus on providing factual information to provide transparency to the public for discussion, whereas newspapers in the past provided information for discussion with a mind for relevancy and truthfulness. In short: papers then provided content _for_ discussion, whereas today papers invoke discussion _because of_ the content.

Additionally, despite including a large amount of national and international news/happenings, the papers still seemed highly local and much more intimate than today's papers. The advertisements - while still prominent in modern papers - were more visible (sometimes even front page) and locally based. Small announcements would appear, like marriage and death announcements, or even the aforementioned public shamings, that have a feel of small-town community more so than large publication. Lastly, like the Salt Lake City paper, the directory implies that the newspaper was common enough, accessible enough, and local enough that the town's important telephone numbers could be printed in the paper regularly - and on the front page. It suggests the usage was geared towards residents of a small radius, and implies an emphasis on the community rather than the broader reach of the far-away world.
