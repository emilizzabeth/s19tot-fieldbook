## Class Preparation
### March 15

When reading _The Route of a Text Message_, the author at one point says, "you can easily imagine someone wanting to text in Chinese," which made me wonder about the process of encoding (and coding) for other languages. From what I understood (and all the technological talk mostly did not sink in beyond the base level understanding of the process), it seems like the system at some point lets the phone know a certain language scheme was being used, and the data is converted appropriately. Does this apply for all languages and characters? Since most (? I could be wrong?) code, at least in this example, seems to be written in the Latin alphabet, how does the process work when changing characters? Are other alphabets treated like special characters, like the earlier mentioned degree symbol and & sign? Also, why is English (or at least the Latin alphabet) the "language" for coding. Does Arabic code exist, or Russian code? Can a website be built with Russian characters, or are all the hackers out there coding away with English? And as a side note to this author's piece, I appreciated in his closing paragraphs how he acknowledged the human contribution and connection to the technological phenomenon - it really seemed to drive home the point that there's human-ness to technology and that it is a product of human communication.

As an avid twitter user, reading the showcase of bots kind of took the magic away from them. While it is fascinating to read how they source, compile, and reconstruct data to build a new text, it is weirdly disconcerting to know the behind-the-scenes code functions to the bots. Somehow, it is more inhuman to know how the code is designed than it is to know that the bot is bot but still be mystified by how it reproduces shockingly coherent human thought. And, as a fun side note, another fun bot that is a personal favorite of mine is the Big Ben Bot. It doesn't do much, but it just yells BONG BONG BONG for however many times per hour. I also recommend the John Mulaney Bot, which just mashes different quotes and trending topics together.

One final thought, with all the code articles/compilations this week: what part of code, if any, is considered "text"? Is it the final product that the code produces? Is the code itself text? Are only parts of the code text, and others equations? (Or for that matter, are equations text?) Where do we draw the line of when letters become designated to "text", and what "meaning" is the right meaning, or enough meaning?
