## Class Preparation
### March 1

My immediate reaction to the connection between these two pieces is how closely fugitive verses seem to resemble the idea of the meme as presented by Gleick. The parts that most stuck out to me from "Fugitive Verses" were the discussion of scrapbooking, preservation through circulation, and the description of newspapers as "the broadest and least controllable distribution channel for poets during the period" (Cordell and Mullen). Meanwhile, in Gleick's chapter, he describes memes as "spreading knowledge by abstraction and encoding," and transcend the idea of authorship, something that seems to be occurring in the repetition and anonymity of fugitive verses (Gleick 316).

Focusing fully on memes for a moment, it was a bit of a mind-blowing moment to finally have a name put to the concept of "ideas are not unique" and "ideas are not solid." It's something we all somewhat know in theory (especially with the sayings "you can't kill an idea" and "nothing new is original") but have a hard time making tangible. Gleick's description of memes did just that. One thing that did come to mind, is rather than having a set of memes, could it be said that there is only one (1) singular meme? Gleick discusses the difficulty of drawing boundaries between individual memes, drawing a beginning or end or establishing what degree of separation is appropriate removal from the source content before deviating entirely. Considering that, most ideas (or memes) in the world could be interlinked by applying an n+1 to infinity type situation: you can infinitely layer ideas on top of each other and really draw a link between just about anything if you add enough steps or make crazy enough links. It makes me think of those crazy conspiracy (internet) meme videos, like John Oliver's parody, where they draw connections arbitrarily. So if everything is then connected... is it just one giant meme? And, furthermore, is there such a thing as an original meme? Or are all "new" memes thus just modifications of existing memes?
