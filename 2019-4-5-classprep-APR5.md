## Class Preparation
### April 5

_17776_ really had me thinking about what makes a "book" or a "text" again. While the best (in my opinion) way to describe it would be to call it a multimedia project, to some extent it really isn't. Almost all of the plot is a result of text and images, and the video is just another means of conveying that text. If we're going to consider an e-book or an audio book a book, then how is _17776_ not a book as well? It also brought into consideration the idea of preservation, between the idea of preserving humans in these little space explorers (or of humans themselves) and the idea of loss, like The Bulb, parts of the Earth, or of anything harmful/interesting in life. I very much liked the idea that "humans like things the way they are" which seemed to in a roundabout way explain why we do keep preserving things. We experience so much change over the course of time that it's nice to have a reminder of what once was. In this case, preservation seems less anthropological and more sentimental, which is strange because to lose something that old today would be a major scientific tragedy. Yet in a world with little change, losing something that old seems to be less of a "loss" for practical purposes and more of a "loss" to familiarity. And, as a sidenote, the storytelling in this project was incredible. I found myself getting attached to the robots, there were many misdirects ("What happened to the sun?!" "...We're in Alaska."), and the pure creativity required to create something like this is unfathomable to me.
