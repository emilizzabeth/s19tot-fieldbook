## Class Preparation
### April 10

The most terrifying page in _Station Eleven_ so far was Chapter 6 (pages 31-32), titled "An Incomplete List," that literally just lists things that don't exist anymore in the post-epidemic world. Combined with the anecdote about the "man searching for the internet," it made me think all over again about all the things that could be lost because a) they aren't comprehensively written down and b) only a few people know how to do it. We've come so far with technology but things are so compartmentalized that even the simplest of things - like a printing press, for example - would probably be lost technology in a world where so much of the population was decimated by disease. I do have to say, much like Jeevan, a global pandemic like this is one of my biggest fears, for many reasons, but one of which being the aforementioned one, that humanity would be unable to function. The thing that I like so far about _Station Eleven_ is that it implies everything did **not** just implode at once. A lot of apocalyptic fiction makes it seem like cars are just abandoned and electricity ceases, but there are lines in the book about how long gasoline and trucks lasted, and so forth. This would probably be the case in real life - a slow deterioration in the amount of usable technologies as the experts in those fields died off and the ability to manage them diminished. However, given our current topic of archivalism and conservation, would writing down and backing up this information actually help? If there was a written guide "for dummies" on how all the complex technologies we have now are built, fixed, and work, would the average user be able to replicate it in a pinch? Or is it a fruitless effort? Furthermore, is it even possible to create and store this much information? Is it worth spending the time and data to preserve this kind of knowledge, or is it more fruitful to make efforts at improving technology and training a few bright new minds? I don't have answers, just pondering, but in the case of the book's epidemic, it seems like writing everything down might have been the way to go.
