##Class Preparation
###January 23

Whilst discussing the fluctuating language of drums, Gleick reminded me of something I was hoping he would touch on but ultimately did not seem to. In my other class, a linguistics class, we just discussed the malleability of language, and how it adjusts over time to suit the needs of the speaker. Language is a product of necessity - something Gleick does briefly touch on - and it has grown to adhere to what we need it to express. The example of "pilot language" on page 26 was one such fascinating example. When discussing abstract ideas and our ability to build upon the intangible, Gleick saw this adherence of language and explained human desire for exploration and philosophy with it. _However_. Gleick also said something that irked me to no end (unless I misunderstood his point).

Somewhere around pages 36-37, Gleick seemed to imply that thought cannot exist without written language. He states, "Logic might be imagined to exist independent of writing [...] but it did not" (37). I actually had to put the book down to complain to my linguist roommate about how much this claim bothered me. The first _um, excuse me!_ that went off in my head at this claim was the abstraction of thought in bilingual speakers. Most say they do not think in one language or another, but rather experience a whole idea and find the words in the necessary language. This experience of thought thus transcends written language, as it could be said that the bilingual speaker is translating the "language" of thought into a written language. Another point, as brought up by my roommate, is that illiterate humans are by that theory incapable of logical thought (as well as any human under the age of about 5 or younger who has not yet been taught how to read). I would reasonably assume that despite being incapable of expressing themselves in a written language, they can still comprehend logical thought. Either way, this sentence bothered me to no end. The written language, as evidenced by Gleick's research, has brought a multitude of benefits and served many purposes, but I do **not** see it as a gatekeeper of logical thought.

To bring things back around to the example of pilot language, this reading got me thinking about the thought of classification of individual languages. At what point can something be divided into its own language, or at least its own dialect? We wouldn't necessarily call pilot code a dialect, but it seems to encompass more than simple jargon. I suppose this would then call for British English, American English, and Australian English to be separated, if we start considering specialized vocabularies their own languages. It is crazy to think though, that even though someone can be physically speaking your language - words you know the definitions of and comprehend the sound of - they can still be meaningfully those same words in a way you don't comprehend.
