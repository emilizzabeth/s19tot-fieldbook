##Lab Report
###Jan 11

Gitelman states in her writing, "Like old art, old media remain meaningful" (4). Although not _that_ old, Markdown  in its simplest form seems reminiscent of the older, earlier websites from the 90s and early 2000s. Yet, it interacts just as well with modern technology such as GitHub, or as discussed in class, the Notes application on an iPhone. More importantly, it provides a certain sort of accessibility that other forms of coding and digital mediums do not. For those of us who are less-than-technologically-savvy (that includes me), the bare-bones coding style seems to replicate the styles of handwritting used in middle school, or going further back, letters and manuscripts. I can't speak for the middle ages, but in middle school **\*bold emphasis\*** was denoted with asterisks, or something _\_important with stress\__ may have been given an underline. While computers have allowed the integration of flexibility and stylistic choices into printed (and digital) works today, historical writers did not have the options to do so and relied solely on their pens and ability to manufacture such choices. Much in the same way, Markdown requires us to use just the same: our hands and creativity (which can be interpreted as textual symbols) to manufacture an output of creative characters.  In short, Markdown seems to replicate the need to rely on the bare-bones given tools (a keyboard versus a pen) to transform bare text into something beyond the norm. Gitelman may have been referring to more substantial media forms that can be traced linearly over time, however, the concept seems to apply itself well to the functionality of Markdown and writing.
