## Lab Report 6
### Mar 13

Having now worked with a letterpress and setting type, the aspect of historical texts that now seems more distinguished and clarified to me is the aspect of function and use within books during the time. What particularly comes to mind is actually one of the texts I examined in a previous lab, an archival/historical collector's text of London, which at the time strangely seemed to walk the line between mass-production (comparatively to the low production rates of manuscripts) and intimate collector's item (owing to the fact that it was likely a display text, and less than 100 copies existed). Then, I could not comprehend how something could be a physical appreciation of a printer's work, a collector's item _and_ a mass-market (for the time) item, but having worked with type, it now makes sense where the intimacy of the item comes in, because setting the type seems to be an art within itself.

Although we've discussed multiple times not to read into certain aspects of printing and language before type was standardized, this lab almost makes me want to do the opposite. Considering articles like _How Typeface Influences the Way We Read and Think_ in conjunction with the amount of control a typesetter has over the final printed text makes me convinced every choice is intentional (even if those choices are likely made quickly or mindlessly). While intent is impossible to measure, a compelling narrative could still be made for all the choices that went into a printed text to produce the object, and to an effect, control the way it is perceived by its readership. 

Furthermore, considering Gitelman's chapter on _Print Culture (Other Than Codex)_, I can't help but wonder the place for and opinion of single-use print jobs during the time. Were fliers frowned upon by printers because of their relatively short "lifespan" compared to an entire text? Or were they a simple, quick way to make money? Alternatively, was the lifespan of a text simply not considered at that time, because mass printing was new enough that each object was treated with equal respect or disregard? And as for the consumer, at what point did the short-term print job become more of a symbol (like the receipt example Gitelman gives) rather than an impressive physical object? Personally, as I printed, I found myself more inclined to side with appreciation for even short-term print jobs, because they are so personally involved when compared to computerized printing today. The hands-on attachment is not something I expected to come from the lab, but it is something that majorly shaped my opinion of older texts.
