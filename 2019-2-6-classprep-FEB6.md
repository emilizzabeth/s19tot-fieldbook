## Class Preparation
### February 6

Towards the end of the Stephen Fry documentary, Stephen Fry asked a question that got unanswered, and subsequently sent me into a spiral of thoughts that even somewhat continued on in the Borsuk reading. Fry asked, "He's not proofing [the page], is he?" when talking about the inking and reviewing process. It was revealed that the ink mark quality is checked, but they never once mentioned the typeset proofing. It made me wonder if there was such a job at the time (checking the order of the type), or if it was all up to the printer to put it in right and check it himself. In fact, it made me wonder if it would be wise to check it twice, once before - to spare the labor of printing another page if a mistake was made - and once after - to check that nothing went awry in the process.

Then, with errors still on my mind, Borsuk's discussion on page 73 (specifically the uses of "identical copy" and "accelerated the speed of) gave me more concern. Did the speed with which printing presses could print cause printers to be lax, and in turn make more errors? And, did the fact that it was faster than print have a similar effect? _And_. Is it really faster? This one stuck in my mind for more or less the entire reading and while I know I likely won't be able to fully comprehend the answer, my question still is: with the time spent arranging type (backwards type at that), would the delay in organization not outweigh the slower speed of writing by hand? How fast could monks scribe? I'm definitely no expert in either printing or scribing, but this is a lingering fixation of mine.

As a final set of thoughts, Borsuk talks about sensing the hand of the scribe who wrote an old book, and how printed books don't bring the same nostalgia. While Borsuk is right - you don't get the same wonder at holding a printed book - I think it is possible to get a similar feeling. Personally, I get attached to copies of books, especially when I have more than one. Knowing that they are all printed the same, but then also knowing that the one _specific_ copy is _your_ copy gives a special feeling too. It's like out of all the thousands of books out there, this one is _yours_ and I think that's comparably special in the modern age. The uniformity of the printed book allows the reader to impart their own connection, which is arguably more enjoyable and awe-inspiring than knowing another person wrote it by hand. (Not that that isn't impressive, or awe-inspiring, in it's own right. Just that printed books can be wonderful too!)
