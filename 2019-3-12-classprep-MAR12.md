## Class Preparation
### March 12

Not to be cliche and bring things back to "the medium is the message" piece (or at least I think this is from the same piece), but the description in _The Information_ about the Napoleonic-era telegraph (or rather, Chappes's telegraph) reminded me of the example of light being the means by which writing and other communication are possible. I believe we also talked about this in class, and during the candlelight lab. The chapter started off discussing electricity, and then jumped to describing the signal system of the early telegraph, and it just stuck with me the idea that the "modern" telegraph is really just the same method of communication linked to an electronic vehicle. When I say this I in no way mean to diminish the achievements of these communicatory inventors, but broken down to the barest bits, things such as the telegraph really seem like a language invention alongside a vehicular invention. When we think of the telegraph, we tend to conflate the two, but really they are two separate achievements combined to make something much more extraordinary. Thus, it would be interesting to reconsider all sorts of inventions by breaking down their characteristics: was the invention of standardized time an invention in technology (the railroad, accurate clockwork, etc), communication (the act of relaying messages across long distances), or time (inventing an actual time itself)? I especially appreciated when Gleick took the time to break down the aspects of Morse code and telegraph communication - it actually read like a New York Times article attempting to capture text-speak today. 

And, as a weird hypothetical question, the third chapter on telephones and all the mathematics/physics that went along with it made me wonder about the innate human nature for communication, and how if humans had to start all over again 1) how many people would understand the structures of communication we've built up around us to be able to replicate it again? 2) would we even build up a structure of communication the same way, now that "needs" and culture have changed? 3) how important is technology to communication, and have they become so far interlinked (like the telegraph) that they are now impossible to separate?
