##Class Preparation
###January 11

In Understanding Media, McLuhan seems to be trying to convey the point that technologies are neither good nor bad, they just are. It reminds me of the popular phrase "guns don't kill people, people kill people." McLuhan seems to not want to blame technologies for things - such as taking ones job or "causing too much trash to circulate" - nor not to thank it for things either - such as brain surgery. The anaology to light is an apt one: it's there in the background, and it can be harmful or helpful but we pay little attention to the fact that so many things are a result of its existence.  We pay closer attention to the things that happen as a result of it that we don't take the time to realize without it, we wouldn't have anything, and thus it is equally as important to be considered when talking about the bigger picture. McLuhan then applies this to print and speech and the consumer's unawareness to text, language, and medium.

In Gitelman's piece, she describes media as "very particular sites for very particular, importantly social as well as historically and culturally specific experiences of meaning" (8). This seems to tie in with what McLuhan was discussing above, about medium being an unexplored facet of the full picture. Gitelman and McLuhan seem to be attempting to explain the same point in this way, although Gitelman seems much much interested in the circumstances surrounding media and its interplay with the world, while McLuhan seems interested in the medium itself and what comes of it.
