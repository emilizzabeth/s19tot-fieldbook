## Class Preparation
### February 13

When Gitelman talked about the "others" aspect of print media - everything aside from books and newspapers essentially - and stated that "survival rates may vary" for printed sheets that "never end up in books at all," it made me wonder about the classifications of printed items today, and how it can be quantified, categorized, or analyzed (189; 186-187). Receipts are briefly brought up later in the text, but even setting aside what Gitelman considers "used material," the amount of print items today is astonishing. And, much like in earlier centuries, there is no way to really know how much is printed, because a lot of it is recycled, never counted, used privately, and so forth. This seems to be one thing that Gitelman is struggling with, but I still want to re-raise the question: where do we draw the line with print? Personally, I do agree that there are "used" items, but there are still minorly _read_ items, such as pamphlets, fliers, or public art poetry. And, is everything that is printed consider print media? Does print media need to be further specified, as Gitelman discusses in her opening? Are syllabuses print in the same way that a proper-use booklet on a product is print? I'd also like to disagree with Gitelman's assertion of used media. Just because something is thrown away, or not academically analyzed, doesn't make it any less "read" or "print." Most people might not read receipts, and the physical form of a receipt is often the more important part of the object rather than what how it phrases its content, but then by this logic, we might as well discount early print advertisements as non-print. Those were, at the time, intended to be "used" rather than "read", were they not? Yet we still consider them to be print. I definitely Gitelman's point, and concede that she has a valid argument, but I just think that this is a subjective viewpoint that needs more nuance added.

As for Benjamin Franklin's autobiography, one aspect that really stood out to me was towards the very beginning, when Franklin talks about how working at the print shop improved his spelling. He also mentions how he would try and write the books from memory, which reminded me of the _How to Read like a Renaissance Reader_ piece from last week. This aspect aside, I was mostly struck by how differently Franklin's biography reads with and without some prior knowledge of printing and the printing industry. I forget when exactly it was, but I have at some point read this text (though I didn't realize it until parts kept sounding familiar and I thought, _I've definitely read this somewhere before..._) - and once I acknowledged the familiarity, small bits kept sticking out that I _didn't_ seem to remember, but in reality I think it was just my lack of understanding of the topic. I must have understood "He's running a publishing business, cool," and not comprehended much more, but the opening of a printing press in this re-read struck me as much more of  an endeavor than in my first read. The line that sticks out particularly is, "Our first papers made a quite different appearance from any before in the province; a better type, and better printed," because of the different ways this could be understood. Past me, and many students unfamiliar with print, might just think, "_Weird, he thinks his papers are better. How can one type of print just be better than the other? It's all the same!_" Whereas on the other hand, now, I understand what an accomplishment this really would have been.
