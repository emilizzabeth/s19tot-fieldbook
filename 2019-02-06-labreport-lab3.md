## Lab Report
### Feb 6

I still have flowers on my mind from the poster session, and from my capstone class, which is what led me to connect flowers and refrigeration as an additional media-technology relationship. While flowers, both as a language and decoration, existed long before the existence of refrigeration, the technology does impact the mass-production of flowers today. Roses are considered a classic symbol of love, but without the combination of refrigeration with floral bouquets, this may not have happened. For example, if we consider the amount of flowers or gardening space in an urban area, the size is not nearly proportionate to the population living there. Without a readily accessible supply of flowers, partners may have turned to something cheap and easy to find (perhaps chocolates might be even more popular, or perhaps something entirely new, like a lock on a fence or names in a tree would be significantly more popular as a sign of affection than they are today - bearing in mind they are already _popular_ but not **widely** so as a commonly gifted symbol like flowers are). Thus, with the existence of refrigeration, even though urbanity grew and greenspace decreased, flowers are still able to be transported for significant time and distance. They are able to be farmed en mass for public consumption and remain a symbol of love, as well as a household decoration, thanks to this technology.

Turning back to candlelight, the entire process of manuscript making seems all the more tedious. We frequently discussed in class the efforts of scribes, but not as much the other jobs which must have surrounded the process. Velum-making and binding surely were equally as affected by candle-light, especially considering any job that required cutting materials. Candlelight is difficult to see by, and sharp objects must have been risky to deal with. A thought that crossed my mind with regard to the _Making Manuscripts_ video is the use of paints. Artists are particular with studio lighting; were illuminators the same way? Did painting by candlelight affect the colors, speed/slow the drying process, or in any other way hinder the artistic process? Returning once again to the scribes, though, Chaucer's _Words to His Scrivener_ takes on an entirely new perspective when adding the candlelight aspect into consideration. Perhaps Chaucer saw it as laziness and stupidity, however, equally to blame could be fatigue or poor visibility. 

Considering visibility, the rise of the codex form seems like it could be a illumination adaptation as much as a practical/physical adaptation. Thinking back to Borsuk's description of writing progression on tablets and scrolls, the codex format allows the reader to keep the object relatively close to the candle/light source without moving either object. Pages are turned, but the mass of the codex and the candle remain in the same place. Reading a tablet or a scroll, however, may have forced the movement of either object. 

Considering candlelight as a "media adjacent" technology for this lab and concentrating on its effects made me realize how little I, and I'm assuming people from the past (excluding maybe scribes) considered the effects of light sources. Bringing up Chaucer again, he likely thought little of the issues raised by candlelight.
