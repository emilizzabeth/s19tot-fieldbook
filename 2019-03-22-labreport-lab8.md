## Lab Report 8
### Mar 22

Looking back at the Electronic Literature Collection of bots, and thinking as I attempt to code my own bot, there is definitely a creative aspect to coding. Yes, there is (arguably) more structure required than a piece of literature - the code does have to work after all - but the ability of the author to experiment with subject, tone, and genre is equally as variable as any work written by a person. And, if we were to get very technical about it, the code was still made by a person, even if the bot-produced content is not.  A human still had to set up the bot and ask it to create a certain subset of things, and therein is where the creativity lies, alongside the intricacies of the code itself. As I write my own code, I'm realizing the small decisions that the outsider might not notice, but the coder has to make, are aspects of creativity as well. How long should the word lengths be? How frequently should the word occur? Which aspects of the tweets should be bot-produced, and which should be standardized? The whole process is entirely more creative on the human end than first meets the eye.

Because there is a human authorship linked to bot content, I do think that the produced content deserves to be considered literature, but as far as how it fits into the grand scheme of things, I could only speculate. It is such a new subfield that it is difficult to create any hardfast categorizations, but one thing that comes to mind is that an entire new set of standards needs to be internalized for bots. Thinking back to the example of the Congress Bot we discussed in class, bots can't really be blamed for mistakes such as that, and neither can the author of the bot. The author of the bot cannot anticipate every possible outcome of the bot, while at the same time the bot does not have the human consciousness to decide whether material is appropriate. (And if it did, that would be frightening... AI still scares me). That being said, I think that bot content should also be treated just as legitimately as any other poetry or writing. When it comes down to it, the human brain and the bot are just "machines" throwing words together. We can trick ourselves into thinking we need creativity to do so, but when you get down to the nitty gritty, it really is just throwing words together that appease the structure defined by a greater set of rules. For a brain, that is language structure and grammar. For a computer, that is the code. Defining whether either the human-created material or the bot-created material is "good" is personal, or for a field of scholars to decide, but that is not something necessarily controlled by output so much as perception. So to rein in this whole section: it would be unfair to equally compare a bot-written piece with a human written piece, at least in this point in time. However, as long as a bot piece is labeled as such, it is worth studying from a literary perspective as a different genre of work and appreciating the creativity that the author used to guide a bot to produce the work.
