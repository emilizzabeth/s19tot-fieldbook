## Class Preparation
### April 2

This week's reading was both comforting and concerning all at once. It was comforting, because reading that there are archivalists working constantly to maintain stored data gives me peace of mind when worrying about all the information that could be lost (like the library of Alexandria). But, it was _very_ concerning on a number of levels: the idea that our technology today is less stable than old technology is personally concerning, while the thought that all data has a shelf life is universally concerning. We tend to think that once we put something on a harddrive, it's "safe" and "saved," but this article makes it very clear that this isn't the case. In a way, it makes books look "higher tech" for their staying power comparative to new computer technology. But again, it just shows that nothing is permanent, no matter how badly we want it to be. As for the idea that everything will be always online - as was touched on in the second piece - I outgrew this idea early, as I watched many of the games, websites, and stories I used to read be deleted or edited by the whims of their creators. (Of course, our solution was to save them to our harddrives... but as we also just learned, even that isn't permanent).

Then again, as the internet becomes an essential posting free-for-all, is it really necessary to try to save everything? Personally, I know there are so many saved files on everything from floppy disks to CDs to flashdrives that I no longer look at and probably don't remember even exist. On the internet, there's so many webpages that have seen only a handful of visitors, and those same visitors probably never care to visit it again. It reminds me of the earlier discussion on one-use print jobs and on modern receipts, and how these are largely not preserved simply because they don't really need to be. Where do we need to draw the same line with data archival? Is there such a thing as too much preservation? Will people hundreds of years from now take the same interest in menial data as we do to coins that are thousands of years old? Can those two things even be compared? Basically: what is the place of data preservation, be it print or digital? At what point are we saving things "just to save it" or just because it's old - and are those things still worth saving?
