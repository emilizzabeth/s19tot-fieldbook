## Class Preparation
### March 26

The combination of the reading for this class and the short film, while similar in their attitude to "digital is taking over," seemed mismatched. For Uzanne, books are entirely becoming extinct in this fantasy world (or is it?) of his, while for the newspaper, the physical paper still exists, just without the team of printers behind the job. In all honestly, the news staff seemed to take things better than the characters/people in the reading did, because at least one of the news staffers seemed to realize that computers would become useful to people and that life goes on without the printing press. The sentence "Either the books must go, or they will swallow us up!" seems to fully encapsulate the reading's attitude towards digitalization, one that is polarized from the film. Weirdly enough, the argument the reading presents does make sense - at first. Yes, it would be nice to spend time in nature, and yes audiobooks now are a big thing. However, I think technology is now more invasive and absorbing than books, and we do need our ears and hearing to be attentive to the world around us just as much as, if not more than, our eyes. Put together, there seems to be a common thread of "the end all be all" of "XYZ"-media in a few of the pieces we've read, which I really don't think will ever be the case. While media may cease to exist in widespread use, many will still find a purpose for it or continue to use it for pleasure and preference alone. For example, Kindles/e-books/audiobooks are incredibly popular, but it is doubtful they will ever fully replace the book because the book is such a big part of history so some will undoubtedly use it, while others merely prefer hold a physical book than any of the aforementioned objects. I think this applies across any of the "end of the---" pieces, and I think that while acceptance of new media is key, much like the man in the short film, old media will still be around in some way, shape, or form.
