## Class Preparation
### April 12

From today's section of _Station Eleven_, the part that stood out to me the most was Miranda's final weeks and some things that were said from her perspective. The first thing that stood out to me was while Miranda was in Malaysia and was thinking that the Georgian flu was just some health crisis in Russia or some other country. This felt all too real to me and echoed the way the world reacted to Ebola at first - it wasn't a problem until it was a problem for North America. And, I think this is a sentiment that we apply to too many things - including archivalism (among others like global warming, etc). It's something we forget to do because we think the things we have will always be around. Yet, _Station Eleven_ shows just how quickly the things that "could never happen", happen. The other section that stood out to me was at the beginning of Chapter 39 (page 205), when the book states, "She saw ghosts of herself everywhere here." Perhaps this is a bit too meta, but the following paragraph, describing the way that Miranda "sees" herself in ages past, reminds me of the way Miranda was collecting artifacts of Arthur as a connection to the past. And, even stretching it further back into the idea of preservation, to what extent can we allow memory to be considered a means of self-preservation? 

One other thing that stood out to me after mentioning it in last class was the idea of who the narrator is. I don't have an answer to that question, but I will say that the narrative voice speaks like they're speaking to someone that the epidemic hasn't yet happened to. This is something I've found really fascinating about the book's structure so far, the fact that it always has one foot in the past and one in the future, and the two are never really far apart.
