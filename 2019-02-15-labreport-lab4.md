## Lab Report 4
### Feb 15

Thinking about this week's lab, in conjunction with the Stephen Fry documentary, what first comes to mind when discussing "composition" is the idea that text today isn't quite "composed" in the same way. To physically print a piece, though faster than handwriting as Borsuk went on to describe, is much slower than the modern form we know as print. Thus, I think modern readers tend not to think of a text as _composed_ but rather just existing, or at the very least, it could be considered "shared." The same careful process of physical printed does not necessarily extend today, and people are free to _share_ what is on their minds with relative ease. Extending this onward then to _How to Read Like a Renaissance Reader_, part of the reason why this piece might be so concerning to modern readers (like me, who was shocked at the amount of attention demanded for every reading of every piece) is because the value of the printed word is no longer high. We subconsciously, and sometimes fully consciously, consume printed text haphazardly, knowing that it came into existence with little physical effort compared to style of printing done in this lab. Without this laborious aspect to it, printed mediums are meant to be consumed and discarded, whereas considering the material aspects of print culture in the past makes us stop and think about the intended permanency of these objects.

As far as mediums go, having to carefully compose type on a printing press definitely could be related back to other mediums mentioned in _The Book_. Tablets and scrolls come most readily to mind, especially because the act of making them was separated from the content creation, much in the same way the content is created separately from the physical creation of a printed item on a press. And, in a way, it even relates to the manuscripts that came shortly before the printing press itself. Since scribes copied from pre-existing content to create their final piece, printers are much in the same way reproducing a product for an audience. The printing press really throws introspection on where the value of a work lies: does it come from the content? Or the labor? Or is the final product inseparable in the pieces that made it a tangible item? Though the printing press is arguably less hands-on than a manuscript, scroll, or clay tablet, it still has a printer's unique touch and some stylistic choices, and it is still cautiously constructed. I suppose, then, another way to consider this relationship of mediums rather than looking at how composition sets it apart for consumption, would be to look at it as considering how the mediums are similar in modes of composition with a different intended consumption method.
