##Class Preparation
###January 16

When speaking about ancient scrolls as storytelling and forms of writing, Mak states, "Designers craft the ‘page’ of the scroll by juxtaposing text with the absence of text, or image with the absence of image," (12).  As she continues on in her analysis of the development of the page over the centuries, she approaches it much in the same way Professor Hillary Chute taught approaching graphic novels. It struck me as eerily similar: the use of images, blank spaces, page layout, page size, and even font as a matter of affecting the reader's perception of the work. Except, in Professor Chute's class, the analysis was intended solely for graphic novels, whereas here Mak applies it to non-imaged work. 

I don't disagree that this method is an effective way of studying the written (or digital) page. In fact, it makes me wonder what can be said about uniform printed pages in today's world, especially with regard to historical understanding. While the use of computers, photography/videography, and file storing will allow future historians a much more detailed "picture" (if you will) of the writing process today, I can't help but wonder if something will be lost in mere digital format. Will the history that could be told by papyrus, pig skins, and their class relations be diminished by the commonality of private and public computer access? Furthermore, will the bland academic format used widely across many books and forms of writing be seen as a lack of character? Or will future historians laugh at us for our need to conform to uniform standards as a means of being taken seriously?
