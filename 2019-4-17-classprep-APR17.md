## Class Preparation
### April 17

For today's class prep, I was thinking about the Museum of Civilization, and once again the subject of preservation, especially with the recent losses from the Notre Dame fire. What stood out to me the most was the difference in preserving something pre- and post-tragedy. For example, in the Museum of Civilization, these items are saved after they are no longer usable or recognizable to the majority of the population. The same could be said of a lot of artifacts we see in modern museums: we _think_ they _were_ important, but today they hold significance to us because they've been around for so long and represent a time before our own. The thought that cane to mind after this was, when we save things that are still "in use" (files, data systems, etc - essentially, all the things we talked about in the _File Not Found_ Series - are we more selective about what we preserve, because we are saving it with the knowledge of its usability? 

The other question that came to mind at the end of _Station 11_ is whether collapse of history and/or civilization is inevitable, and if when it happens, it is as big of a deal as we make it out to be. In the case of _Station 11_, or even in today's world, a disease defying vaccination (which is entirely likely) that wipes out a significant portion of the population would likely render us useless, but as we see at the end, people do eventually learn to rebuild. It might take a few decades to rebuild to the same extent, but it is possible. And, while there is much that has been lost, moving forward there is more room for innovation. I guess, in short, while it is awe-inspiring to access items from museums, will there ever reach a point in history where we need to reconsider what we're saving and why? And can something still be considered important to save if we don't even have the ability to use it? (In my opinion, yes, but this book for me raised a lot of questions about conservation, how we approach it, and how it should be handled in a rapidly changing world - whether that change be forward or backward).
