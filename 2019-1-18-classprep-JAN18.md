##Class Preparation
###January 18

After reading part of _The Book_ by Amaranth Borsuk, specifically a chapter so focused on the history and adaptation of the written "book" (and its peripheral forms), I can't help but wonder how solid our current format of choice will be for the future. Yes, the book more or less as we know it _has_ been around for quite some time, with slight variations in binding, material, and style, but the tablet, scroll, and jiance were equally as significant for large periods of time. The book today is relatively cheap to produce, sturdy for long (enough) periods of time, and easy to interact with. Yet, what changes will we see to it in the future? Are there less wasteful and more economical options than paper and ink (if we set aside technology as an option)? Is there a better form than page after page? What about size, binding, language, imagery, and so forth? Mostly, I am curious whether we have plateaued, per say, in the format of the book, and if the future will ever see (nontechnological) changes to the way it is made. That being said, will technology ever overtake the book completely? And what are we losing, and gaining, by submitting to something intangible, yet real all the same? 

Ponderings about future bookmaking aside, there was one small comment that also struck me. On page 20, the author talks about re-winding and re-reading scrolls, and mentions the "cyclical nature" of the Torah. For some reason, this reminded me of Finnegans Wake and its own cyclical nature. So, in a way, even though we lost the physical forms of scrolls and tablets, some of the traditions do carry on in the occasional (wacky/brilliant) book.
