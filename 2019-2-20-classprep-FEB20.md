## Class Preparation
### February 20

Before I share any constructive thoughts on the readings for next class, I just have to say that I got incredibly excited when reading the 1860 volume on The English Woman's Journal, because the Victoria Press was just down the road from where I used to live in London. The piece mentioned Goodge Street and I was like _THAT'S BY ME I LOVE THAT STATION!_ (It has a fun name). I looked up the address on GoogleMaps, and I've walked past the Victoria Press (now the BBC) several dozen times. Anyways, that really excited me and gave the article a sense of tangibility that historical documents sometimes lack through general disconnect from the content.

That aside, I found it fascinating that the London News (the photo article) had a much more supportive attitude than that of Mrs. Grundy (who, I had difficulty discerning the title or importance of). Perhaps I am misreading the tone, but if she found it to be "Clearly woman's work," then why was she so negatively opposed to the _English Woman's Journal_? Or did she not find it to be "clearly woman's work as the authors of the journal proposed? I also found it to be counter-intuitive to the message of the journal for the authors to delegate certain parts of printing to men or women based on physical characteristics. I suppose it is a step in the right direction to insinuate men and women could work side-by-side in the same business (albeit in separate aspects of the job) but it still felt strange for such a progressive group to be relegating themselves to work suited to small hands, as I believe they said.

As for Werner's blog article, the thing that kept occurring to me is how JK Rowling shortened her name to initials so that her books would appeal to a multi-gendered audience. Specifically, when she talked about the EA imprint, it made me curious how many women would have printed under their husbands' names, under false names, or unambiguously gendered names (Sam, Alex, and so forth). It also made me curious whether there was a stigma around female-printed books, or whether people paid no mind to their publishers.
