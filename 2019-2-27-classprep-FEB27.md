## Class Preparation
### February 27


Wow, I have SO much to say on the topic of reading as bad that I don't even know where to start. Firstly, I have to say it is endlessly amusing to me to hear Backus state that fiction "borrows [reality] only to corrupt" because a) this is so far from the truth in most cases, and b) it's a bit of irony to think that the Old Testament of the Catholic Bible is """"technically"""" fiction. (And I put that in a number of quotation marks because religion is relative to the believer and there is no way to know _anything_ for certain, and I could easily be as misled as the next person. So, disclaimers aside): I had a theology teacher in my _very_ Catholic high school explain to us that much of the Old Testament was fictional, or exaggerated truth, to teach a lesson, and are not meant to be taken literally (i.e., all the books are extended parables; her example was, Yes, God created the Earth _but_ it took him a lot more than 7 days). Basically, I'm just a really amused product of Catholic school who thinks it's awfully mighty of these collective pieces to be discussing the detriments of fictional morality lessons when that's _kiiiind of_ what the Bible is meant to be (again, depending on your viewpoint. No disrespect to anyone or any religions intended.) 

And, as a fast reader, I take personal offense to the statement, "No one can have time for reflection, who reads at this rapid rate," from page 31 of "Devouring Books." The introspection comes **after** the reading, anyways. If anything, people who read faster have more access to varying materials, and can make more informed reflections by drawing on other examples. Which leads me to the quote: "Consequently ideas drawn from that source, are likely to be adopted by the youthful reader, before his mind has been accustomed to reflect, compare, reason, and judge for himself," from "The Guardian" page 46. How are readers supposed to be able to reflect, compare, reason, and judge if they don't have practice reading and thinking critically on pre-existing works? Their opinions have to start somewhere, and their opinions can change over time. That's growth, and that's learning. (Which, as a side note, is what I find so harmful about the internet culture which shuts down people based on one comment, especially one from far in the past. People are people, they mess up and that's how they learn. Their opinions can change but they have to start somewhere).

And bringing it full circle, speaking of the modern day and the internet, these pieces all sound awfully familiar, re: arguments on video games, the internet, and movies. The particular quote which reminded me of this was, "The misfortune is, that the stimulants used to attract at first, must be not only continued, but heightened to keep up the attraction," (47).  It's both frightening and amusing that nothing much has changed over time, from the Greeks being worried about writing technology and memory loss, to "devouring novels" being seen as detrimental, and now up to the internet being seen as harmful (although sometimes it can be, admittedly). In a way, it just seems that people are a bit terrified of change from the status quo and will try to make excuses to justify their reactions.
